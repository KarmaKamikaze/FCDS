# P2-Project

This program is designed to simulate the effect of adding idle zones to a food courier delivery service.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
 ## Getting Started
 
 To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps. 
 
 ### Installation 

 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KarmaKamikaze/P2-Project
```
 2. Navigate to the root folder and run `index.js` with `NodeJS`

```sh
node .\node\index.js
```

 3. While the server is running, open the site on port `3190` in a browser 

```sh
http://localhost:3190/
```

Alternatively, the program can be accessed directly on [GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### Using the program

 1. Graph visualization

`Number of graphs:` The amount of simulations to show and run simultaneously.

`Graph size:` Specifies which of the graph presets to use (see [here](#graph-presets)).

`Simulation algorithm:` Specifies which of the shortest-path algorithms to use.

`Idle zones:` The maximum amount of idle zones to generate.

`Order frequency:` The rate at which orders are generated in each restaurant.

`Ticks per second:` The rate at which the simulation runs. 1 tick corresponds to one minute in simulation time.

`Courier frequency:` The maximum amount of couriers to generate.

`Obstruction level:` The number of edges to add random obstructions on (which affects the weight of an edge).


 2. Headless simulation page

Wot is dis and how variables are there now here ???
